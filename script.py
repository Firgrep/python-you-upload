# NOTES:
# 1. This sample code uploads a file and can't be executed via this interface.
#    To test this code, you must run it locally using your own API credentials.
#    See: https://developers.google.com/explorer-help/code-samples#python
# 2. This example makes a simple upload request. We recommend that you consider
#    using resumable uploads instead, particularly if you are transferring large
#    files or there's a high likelihood of a network interruption or other
#    transmission failure. To learn more about resumable uploads, see:

=======================================

AHILLEAS ROKNI completed his PhD thesis in philosophy in 2022, under the supervision of Professor Stephen Houlgate, at the University of Warwick. His thesis aimed to give an account of the much-debated move from the Science of Logic to the Philosophy of Nature in Hegelâ€™s system. Ahilleasâ€™s main research concerns are Hegelâ€™s Logic, philosophy of nature, philosophy of science, and aesthetics. Ahilleasâ€™ overarching interest is in the cohesiveness of Hegelâ€™s systematic philosophy. Hegelâ€™s philosophy is not just the Science of Logic or the Philosophy of Right but is an account of how abstract metaphysics immanently develops into concrete reality This was the impetus behind his PhD research and it is the impetus behind his interest in sPhil: to continue to interrogate whether Hegelâ€™s systematic philosophy is coherent.

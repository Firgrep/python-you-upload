=======================================

AHILLEAS ROKNI completed his PhD thesis in philosophy in 2022, under the supervision of Professor Stephen Houlgate, at the University of Warwick. His thesis aimed to give an account of the much-debated move from the Science of Logic to the Philosophy of Nature in Hegel‚Äôs system. Ahilleas‚Äôs main research concerns are Hegel‚Äôs Logic, philosophy of nature, philosophy of science, and aesthetics. Ahilleas‚Äô overarching interest is in the cohesiveness of Hegel‚Äôs systematic philosophy. Hegel‚Äôs philosophy is not just the Science of Logic or the Philosophy of Right but is an account of how abstract metaphysics immanently develops into concrete reality This was the impetus behind his PhD research and it is the impetus behind his interest in sPhil: to continue to interrogate whether Hegel‚Äôs systematic philosophy is coherent.
